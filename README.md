# FaceGen-Models

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for training and visualizing models using various datasets and techniques. Below is a brief description of each notebook included.


1. Training Model on SVHN and MNIST Dataset: This work demonstrates how to train models on the SVHN and MNIST datasets. It includes data preprocessing, model architecture, training loops, and evaluation metrics.

2. Cropping Visuals: This work is focused on visual processing tasks, specifically cropping images. It may include image loading, manipulation, and visualization techniques using libraries like OpenCV or PIL.

3. Face Interpolation using Generative Model: This work uses a pre-trained Progressive GAN model to interpolate and generate high-quality face images. It covers loading the model, generating images, and visualizing results using PyTorch and Matplotlib.
